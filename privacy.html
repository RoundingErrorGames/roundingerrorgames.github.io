      <p>
        We place a high value on your privacy, just as we do on our own privacy.
        We reject business models which monetize your data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our application, Deciduous: Emergent, does not collect any data.
        Deciduous will support limited preferences, such as a left-handed mode
        and color customization, but this data is never uploaded to any servers.
        We also do not collect data on game progress, saved games, app usage
        patterns, etc.  We believe that we can build a successful business
        without surveilling our customers.  We are taking a leap of faith that
        we do not need any information about you which you do not decide we
        need.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of v0.1.5, Deciduous has no network connectivity whatsoever.  As of
        March 2025, Rounding Error Games does not operate any app-connected
        services.  We do collect crash reports via our app.  During testing, we
        may show the user a crash report and invite them to email it
        to <a href="mailto:support@roundingerrorgames.com">support@roundingerrorgames.com</a>, but the app itself will not send any data to any service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note, we only control our applications.  We have no control over
        what data is collected by your device or platform.  All we can promise
        is that you won't be surveilled by Rounding Error Games.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future we may support limited uploads.  These will all be on a
        voluntary basis - think, "May we email this crash report for you?" or
        "This is a high score, would you like to upload to the leaderboard?"
        Any networking will be announced here in advance, will probably be part
        of a future app and not Deciduous: Emergent, and none will run by
        default nor without user consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warm regards,
        <br>
